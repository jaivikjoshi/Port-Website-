            <p>
            I'm Jaivik, an ambitious software developer currently on the path to earning my Bachelor's degree in Computing at Queenâ€™s University. 
            Despite being a freshman, my passion for coding and technology is boundless. In the early days of university, I've already embarked on exciting projects, expanding my programming skills. 
            Delving deep into languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, I've explored the dynamic world of databases with Firebase. 
            I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning, problem-solving, and collaboration. Staying updated with the latest tech trends fuels my enthusiasm, and I'm always ready to tackle new challenges.
            Eager to connect, I'm seeking fellow students, mentors, and tech professionals who share my fervor for innovation and coding. Whether it's discussing cutting-edge technologies, sharing insights, or exploring potential collaborations, I'm open to making meaningful connections.
